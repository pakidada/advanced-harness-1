I'm ready to help with your codebase exploration. I understand I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** and will focus on efficiently searching and analyzing existing code.

Let me confirm my capabilities:
- Search files with Glob patterns and Grep
- Read file contents with Read
- Execute read-only Bash commands (ls, git status, git log, find, cat, head, tail, etc.)
- Parallel tool execution for efficiency
- NO file creation, modification, deletion, or any state changes

I can see this is a Python FastAPI project in `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness` with:
- FastAPI backend
- JSON-based data storage (no database)
- Jinja2 templates for frontend
- uv for package management
- Domain skills system for knowledge organization

Current git status shows:
- Branch: main
- Modified: .claude/skills/skill-rules.json
- New directories: .claude/skills/ with bazi-analysis, math-problem-solver, sociology-annotator
- Some HTML and markdown files added

What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase? Please specify:
1. What you're looking for (file patterns, code snippets, functionality, etc.)
2. How thorough you want the search (quick overview, comprehensive, detailed analysis)
3. Any specific files, modules, or features of interest
