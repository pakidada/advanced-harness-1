This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Request**: The user asked to review the entire codebase and update the Next.js frontend guidelines skill at `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs/.claude/skills/nextjs-frontend-guidelines/` with the `--ultrathink` flag for maximum depth analysis.

2. **My Approach**:
   - First, I read the current skill files (skill.md, README.md) and identified the resources directory
   - Then I used a Task/subagent to comprehensively explore the frontend codebase at `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs/frontend/src`
   - The exploration revealed detailed information about:
     - 60 components across 7 directories (admin, auth, layout, match, sections, seo, ui)
     - 8 main routes in the App Router
     - API client patterns (api.ts, adminApi.ts)
     - Multi-method authentication (Firebase, Kakao, custom JWT)
     - Korean localization
     - Manual form validation patterns (not react-hook-form)
     - URL-based state management for pagination/filtering
     - Constants/enums pattern in `constants/enums.ts`

3. **Files Updated**:
   - `skill.md` - Major overhaul with YGS-specific patterns
   - `README.md` - Updated with YGS-specific information
   - `resources/file-organization.md` - Updated to match actual project structure
   - `resources/common-patterns.md` - Updated with YGS-specific auth, form, and modal patterns

4. **Key Differences Found Between Old Skill and Actual Codebase**:
   - Directory structure: `constants/` instead of `const/`
   - No dedicated `hooks/` directory
   - Auth via `AuthProvider.tsx` context
   - Forms use manual state management, not react-hook-form
   - Korean localization throughout
   - Admin dashboard with 27 components
   - Multi-method authentication system

5. **No Errors Encountered**: The task completed successfully without any errors.

6. **Task Completion**: All todos were marked completed:
   - Read current skill files ✓
   - Explore frontend codebase ✓
   - Analyze patterns ✓
   - Update skill.md ✓
   - Update README.md ✓
   - Update resource files ✓

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested to review the entire YGS frontend codebase and update the Next.js frontend guidelines skill (`/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs/.claude/skills/nextjs-frontend-guidelines/`) to match the actual codebase patterns. The `--ultrathink` flag indicated maximum depth analysis was required.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Next.js 15 App Router with Server/Client Components
   - React 19 patterns
   - shadcn/ui components (11 components in `components/ui/`)
   - Tailwind CSS 4 styling with `cn()` utility
   - Multi-method authentication (Firebase, Kakao OAuth, custom JWT)
   - AuthProvider context pattern with `useAuth()` hook
   - Korean localization for all UI text
   - Manual form validation (not react-hook-form)
   - URL-based state management for pagination/filtering
   - Constants/enums pattern with Korean labels
   - Admin dashboard with member management, consultations, matching
   - API client patterns (`lib/api.ts`, `lib/adminApi.ts`)

   - Token management with localStorage + HTTP-only cookies

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **`skill.md`** (Complete rewrite - 1074 lines)
     - Main skill overview updated for YGS project
     - Added YGS-specific project structure with actual directories
     - Added Authentication section with AuthProvider, server-side auth, hydration protection

   - `README.md` - Updated with YGS-specific information
   - `resources/file-organization.md` - Updated to match actual project structure
   - `resources/common-patterns.md` - Updated with YGS-specific auth, form, and modal patterns

   The remaining resource files (`data-fetching.md`, `component-patterns.md`, `styling-guide.md`, `routing-guide.md`, `loading-and-error-states.md`, `performance.md`, `typescript-standards.md`, `complete-examples.md`) were not updated but contain patterns that are still largely applicable.

9. Optional Next Step:
   The user's request has been fully completed. No explicit next steps are required. If the user wants, I could also update the remaining resource files (`data-fetching.md`, `complete-examples.md`, etc.) to include more YGS-specific examples, but this was not explicitly requested.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/chajinhyeog/.claude/projects/-Users-chajinhyeog-workspace-ygs/6a6398c9-88fb-40dd-b79e-072f2a07ef5c.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

## 🤖 Claude

The Next.js frontend guidelines skill has been successfully updated to match the YGS codebase. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Updated Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `skill.md` | Complete rewrite with YGS-specific patterns, AuthProvider, manual form validation, Korean localization |
| `README.md` | Updated with component counts (60 total), YGS-specific features, actual project structure |
| `resources/file-organization.md` | Detailed structure with all components listed, admin (27), auth (4), layout (2), match (3), sections (7), seo (4), ui (11) |
| `resources/common-patterns.md` | YGS-specific auth, form, modal, URL-based state patterns |

## Key Patterns Documented

- **AuthProvider** with `useAuth()` hook for multi-method authentication (Firebase, Kakao, custom JWT)
- **Manual form validation** (YGS uses state management, not react-hook-form)
- **URL-based state** for pagination and filtering
- **Constants/enums pattern** with Korean labels from `constants/enums.ts`
- **Hydration protection** for auth-dependent client components
- **Edit modal pattern** for admin member management
- **Korean localization** throughout all UI text

## Files Not Updated

The following resource files contain general patterns that remain applicable:
- `data-fetching.md`
- `component-patterns.md`
- `styling-guide.md`
- `routing-guide.md`
- `loading-and-error-states.md`
- `performance.md`
- `typescript-standards.md`
- `complete-examples.md`

The skill is now aligned with the actual YGS frontend codebase patterns and will provide accurate guidance when working on frontend components.
