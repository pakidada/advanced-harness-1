I'll read the plan.md and activity.md files to understand the current state, then execute the tasks.

I need to create the activity.md file and check if the reference analysis exists. Let me also check the existing composition structure.

I have the context. Task 0 (reference analysis) and Task 1 (script) are already marked as `passes: true`. Let me check the existing composition and config to understand the current script, then continue with Task 2 (images).

Now I understand the current state. The script is using the old generic script, not the aggro version from plan.md. Let me create the activity.md and start executing tasks. I need to:

1. ✅ Task 0 (reference analysis) - Done
2. ❌ Task 1 (script) - marked passes:true but script needs updating to aggro version
3. ❌ Task 2 (images) - Need to generate with Replicate
4. ❌ Task 3 (voiceover) - Need to generate with ElevenLabs
5. ❌ Task 4 (sfx) - Need to generate with ElevenLabs
6. ❌ Task 5 (composition) - Need to update config and composition
7. ❌ Task 6 (render) - Need to render
8. ❌ Task 7 (viral-check) - Need to verify

Let me first create the activity.md and update the config with the aggro script:

Now let me update the config.ts with the aggro script:

## 🤖 Claude

Script updated. Now let me check if Replicate MCP is available for image generation. Let me check what MCP servers are available:

## 🤖 Claude

I don't see Replicate MCP directly. Let me check the MCP configuration to understand what's available:

## 🤖 Claude

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

I see Replicate is configured. However, I don't see a direct MCP tool available for Replicate image generation in my tool list. Let me check if there's a Replicate-specific tool pattern. Looking at the tools available to me, I notice I don't have `mcp__replicate__generate_image`.

Given this limitation, let me proceed with what I can do - I'll use ElevenLabs for voiceover and SFX generation, then update the composition with the aggro script. For images, I'll need to work with the existing ones or find an alternative approach.

Let me update the todo and proceed with generating voiceovers and SFX:

Let me first check if the voiceover and sfx directories exist:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The audio files already exist. However, they were generated with the old script. I need to regenerate them with the new aggro script. Let me generate the new voiceovers with ElevenLabs. I'll generate all 5 voiceovers:

It works with the default voice. Now let me generate all voiceovers:

Let me check the Root.tsx to make sure the composition is registered:

---

## 🤖 Claude

---

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

The composition is already registered. Now let me render the video:

There's a browser permission issue. Let me try rendering without the browser GUI:

---

## 🤖 Claude

## 🤖 Claude

The Chrome headless mode issue. Let me try with the new headless mode flag:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

There's a macOS permission issue with Chromium. Let me check if there's an existing Remotion browser and try a different approach:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The browser exists. Let me try removing the xattr and rendering again:

---

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

There's a system-level permission issue with the Chromium browser on macOS. Let me try removing the existing browser and reinstalling:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

There's a network issue. Let me restore and try using Playwright browser instead for rendering:

Let me try using the mcp Playwright browser to take a screenshot for preview. But first, let me check what browsers are available on the system:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

Let me try rendering using Google Chrome directly with updated settings:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

There's a network DNS issue. Let me check connectivity and try a different approach:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The network is blocking access to storage.googleapis.com. Let me try to restore the browser cache from the node_modules:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The browser was removed. Let me see if there's another browser we can use. Let me check if there's a pre-existing Chrome Headless Shell elsewhere:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

There's a puppeteer Chrome headless shell. Let me copy it to the Remotion location:

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

---

## 🤖 Claude

The permission error is a macOS security issue. Let me try using the Remotion Studio to preview instead, or we can try using --disable-sandbox:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The issue is that macOS is preventing the Chromium binary from running due to security restrictions. Let me try using the MCP Playwright browser instead to at least verify the composition looks correct:

There's a file descriptor issue. Let me try to increase the limit and run the render with a specific browser path:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The issue persists. This is a macOS-specific security issue with the Chromium browser process. Let me update the activity log and plan to note this blocker, then update the plan.md:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Edit]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

Let me try one more approach - using the Playwright MCP browser which should be properly configured:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: mcp__playwright__browser_install]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

Good, the browser is installed. Let me check if there's an existing output video we can analyze, and try to run the render differently:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

There's an existing ai-chaos-viral.mp4 from earlier today. Let me analyze it with Gemini Video to see if it meets the viral check criteria, or if it's the old version:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: mcp__gemini-video__analyze_design_video]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The analyzed video is the old version (with "AI가 일자리 뺏는다고?" text). Since I've updated the composition but can't render due to browser issues, let me try one more thing - using the Lambda or different rendering approach. But first, let me see if we can manually trigger the Chrome browser to fix the permission:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

There's a code signing issue. Let me try codesigning the binary:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

Now let me try rendering again:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The MachPortRendezvousServer permission issue is at the macOS kernel level. Let me try explicitly using a different browser - the Google Chrome app:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The Chrome binary on this machine is newer and doesn't support the old headless mode. Let me try with `--headless=shell`:

---

## 🤖 Claude

[Tool: Bash]

---

## 🧑 User

[Tool Result]

---

## 🤖 Claude

The rendering is blocked due to Chrome headless issues. Let me update the todo and activity file with the final status, and explain to the user what was accomplished and what needs to be done next:
