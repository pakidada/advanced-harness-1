# Viral Reel Creator - Ralph Wiggum Routine

## Mission
Create a high-quality viral Instagram/TikTok reel using Remotion.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Read Context
First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

### 2. Check Current State
```bash
cd reels
pnpm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to preview current compositions.

### 3. Find Next Task
Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

### 4. Execute Task
Work on exactly ONE task following these guidelines:

**For Setup Tasks:**
- Use /new-composition command
- Configure Portrait-1080p preset
- Verify structure in reels/src/compositions/

**For Hook Tasks:**
- Reference videos.json for proven hook patterns (check hooking_notes field)
- Use HOOK_PATTERNS.md for implementation examples
- Implement visual effects from VISUAL_EFFECTS.md
- Text MUST be text-9xl for hook

**For Voiceover Tasks:**
- Use mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_speech
- Settings: speed=1.1, stability=0.5, language="ko"
- Output to: reels/public/audio/voiceover-{name}/

**For Quality Tasks:**
- Use Playwright to navigate and take screenshots
- Check voiceover sync (±0.1s tolerance)
- Verify animation speed (damping: 12+, stiffness: 600+)
- Confirm text readability (text-7xl+ minimum)

### 5. Quality Validation
After implementing, use Playwright to:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Select the composition
3. Take screenshots at key frames:
   - Frame 0 (hook start)
   - Frame 180 (3s - hook end)
   - Last frame (CTA)
4. Save as screenshots/{task-name}-{frame}.png

### 6. Update Progress
Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing:
- What you changed
- Which files were modified
- Screenshot filenames
- Quality validation results

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

### 7. Commit
Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message:
```
feat(reel): {task description}

- Implemented {feature}
- Quality checks passed
```

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

### 8. Repeat
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

I'll start by reading the activity.md to understand the current state, then check the plan.md to find the next task.

Let me first check the current state of the reels project and start the dev server.

I can see the compositions. There's already a `vrl-mvp-aggro` composition which appears to be the one we need to work on. Let me check the plan.md task list and determine which task to work on next. Looking at the plan.md I already read, the first task is "setup" with `passes: false`.

Let me check the existing vrl-mvp-aggro composition and the audio files:

I can see:
1. The `vrl-mvp-aggro` composition already exists with Portrait-1080p preset configured
2. The composition has hook, problem, twist, solution, proof, and CTA segments
3. Audio files are referenced but I need to check if they exist

Let me check if the voiceover and SFX files for vrl-mvp exist:
