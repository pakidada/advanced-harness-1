## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze your codebase. I have access to powerful file search and code analysis tools, and I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, read, and analyze code but cannot make any file modifications.

I'm familiar with the SuperClaude framework instructions you have configured, and I'll apply relevant principles like:
- Efficient tool usage (parallel operations where possible)
- Evidence-based analysis
- Clear, structured communication
- Token efficiency when needed

**Current context:**
- Working directory: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/leviosa`
- Project type: Not a git repository
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.0.0)
- Date: 2026-01-03

I'm ready to help you search, explore, and analyze your codebase. What would you like to investigate?
