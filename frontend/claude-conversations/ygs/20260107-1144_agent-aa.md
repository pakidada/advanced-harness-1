I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze code in your project. I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can efficiently search through your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read.

I've reviewed your project context:
- **Monorepo structure**: Backend (FastAPI) + Frontend (Next.js)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12.3, SQLModel, PostgreSQL, domain-driven design
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Key domains**: Auth, Artist, Artwork, Admin, Exhibition, etc.

I understand the project guidelines around:
- Code quality standards (black, isort, ruff, mypy for backend)
- Frontend testing with chrome-devtools MCP
- Authentication flow (JWT-based)
- S3 file uploads with compression
- Database read/write separation patterns

I'm ready to help you search, analyze, and understand your codebase. What would you like me to explore?
