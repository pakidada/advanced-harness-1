I'll start by reading the required context files to understand the current state and execute the plan.

Let me check what's already completed and what assets exist.

I can see the current state:
- ✅ Task 0 (reference analysis): Completed
- ✅ Task 1 (script): Completed  
- ❌ Task 2 (images): `passes: false` - but images already exist!
- ✅ Task 3 (voiceover): Completed
- ✅ Task 4 (sfx): Completed
- ✅ Task 5 (composition): Completed
- ✅ Task 6 (render): Completed
- ✅ Task 7 (viral-check): Completed

The only task marked as `passes: false` is Task 2 (images), but images already exist. Let me verify the images are valid and update the plan.

I can see the current hook.jpg is a friendly-looking Pepper robot - not the threatening "ominous AI robot with glowing red eyes" specified in the plan. The images need to be regenerated with Nano Banana Pro to match the aggressive/viral style requirements.

Let me create the activity.md file and start generating the images with Replicate's Nano Banana Pro model.

Now I'll generate all 5 images in parallel using Nano Banana Pro.

I need permission to use the Replicate MCP tool. Let me try again now that you can grant the permission.

The Replicate MCP tool requires permission to be granted. Once you allow it, I'll generate the 5 images using Nano Banana Pro.

In the meantime, let me create the activity.md file to document our progress.

I need permission to use the Replicate MCP tool (`mcp__replicate__create_predictions`) to generate the 5 viral images with Nano Banana Pro.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Reference analysis complete
- ✅ Script complete  
- ✅ Voiceover files exist (5 files)
- ✅ SFX files exist (3 files)
- ✅ Remotion composition exists
- ❌ **Images need regeneration** - current images are stock photos, not Nano Banana Pro generated with viral style

**Waiting for:** Permission to use `mcp__replicate__create_predictions` to generate:
1. **hook.jpg** - Ominous AI robot with glowing red eyes
2. **problem.jpg** - Desperate office worker with TERMINATED screens
3. **solution.jpg** - Confident professional with holographic AI
4. **proof.jpg** - Futuristic 10X growth dashboard
5. **cta.jpg** - Social media energy burst

Please grant the Replicate MCP permission and I'll proceed with image generation.
