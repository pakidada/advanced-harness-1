I'll help you set up the Claude Code infrastructure. First, let me understand your project structure and what you already have.

I see you already have a comprehensive `.claude` setup with agents, hooks, skills, and commands. Let me examine the current state to understand what needs updating:

I found an issue. The `tsc-check.sh` has hardcoded service names from the original showcase that don't match your project:

```bash
# Current (line 26):
email|exports|form|frontend|projects|uploads|users|utilities|events|database

# Should be:
frontend  # Only your frontend directory
```

Let me fix this:

## Summary

Following the CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, I've updated your project:

### Created: `CLAUDE.md`
Comprehensive project documentation including:
- Tech stack (FastAPI + SQLModel backend, Next.js frontend planned)
- Project structure with paths
- Skills table with activation triggers
- Development guidelines
- Quick reference commands

### Verified Skills Configuration
All 7 skills properly configured in `skill-rules.json`:

| Skill | Type | Path Patterns |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `fastapi-backend-guidelines` | domain | `backend/backend/**/*.py` ✓ |
| `nextjs-frontend-guidelines` | guardrail | `frontend/src/**/*.tsx` ✓ |
| `pytest-backend-testing` | domain | `backend/tests/**/*.py` ✓ |
| `cliwant-brand-guidelines` | guardrail | `**/*.pptx`, presentations |
| `error-tracking` | domain | `**/sentry*.ts`, services |
| `skill-developer` | domain | Meta-skill for skill creation |
| `route-tester` | domain | Route testing |

### Fixed Hooks
Updated hardcoded service names in:
- `tsc-check.sh`: Changed from showcase services to `frontend`
- `trigger-build-resolver.sh`: Changed to `frontend`, `backend`

### Verified
- All hooks executable (`-rwxr-xr-x`)
- `skill-rules.json` valid JSON
- Path patterns match actual project structure

### Note
The `tsc-check` and `trigger-build-resolver` Stop hooks are designed for TypeScript projects. Since:
- Your backend is Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend is not yet set up

These hooks won't trigger until you set up the Next.js frontend. When you do, they'll automatically check TypeScript errors.

## Summary - Adjustments Complete

Using sequential thinking analysis, I identified and fixed the following issues:

### 1. Fixed `skill-rules.json` - pytest path patterns
```diff
- "backend/tests/**/*.py"
+ "backend/backend/tests/**/*.py"
```
The test files are in the nested `backend/backend/tests/` directory, not `backend/tests/`.

### 2. Fixed CLAUDE.md typo
```diff
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSSs
+ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
```

### 3. Added Claude Code Integration section to CLAUDE.md
Added comprehensive documentation including:
- **Skills table** with types and triggers
- **Hooks table** with events and purposes  
- **Agents table** with use cases
- **Commands table** with descriptions
- **Configuration files** reference

### Verification
- ✅ `skill-rules.json` is valid JSON
- ✅ Path patterns match actual project structure (`backend/backend/`)
- ✅ Frontend patterns ready for when frontend is implemented
- ✅ All hooks executable
- ✅ CLAUDE.md now documents both project architecture AND Claude Code integration

### Note on Frontend
The frontend directory is currently empty - your CLAUDE.md documents the **planned architecture**. The skill-rules.json patterns are pre-configured and will activate automatically once you create the Next.js frontend in `frontend/src/`.

- **React 19** 
- **MUI v5** with Emotion
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Lucide React** (icons)
- **next-intl** (i18n ready)

### Key Features
- ✅ MUI v5 syntax (`xs={12} md={4}` Grid props)
- ✅ Server/Client component separation
- ✅ Centralized API client (`@/lib/api`)
- ✅ Server-side auth utilities (`@/lib/serverAuth`)
- ✅ App Router conventions (loading.tsx, error.tsx)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ `@/` import alias

### Quick Start
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
pnpm build        # Production build
```

The skill-rules.json patterns will now auto-activate when editing `frontend/src/**/*.tsx` files.
