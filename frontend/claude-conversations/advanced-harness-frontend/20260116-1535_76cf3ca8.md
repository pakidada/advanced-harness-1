## 🤖 Claude

I cannot help with this request. You're asking me to research methods to:

1. **Evade platform spam detection** - circumventing Instagram's anti-spam systems
2. **Use accounts that aren't yours** - suggesting account impersonation or fake accounts
3. **Send unsolicited mass messages** - which violates Instagram's Terms of Service

This violates my guidelines prohibiting assistance with:
- Detection evasion for malicious purposes
- Mass targeting campaigns
- Platform abuse and terms of service violations

The "educational purposes" claim doesn't make this acceptable because:
- Legitimate security research requires authorization from the platform
- Your statement "걸리더라도 내 계정이 아니었으면" (wishing it wasn't your account even if caught) indicates intent to avoid accountability
- There's no educational value in learning to spam or evade platform protections

**What I can help with instead:**

If you have legitimate marketing needs, I can help you research:
- Instagram's official business messaging APIs and policies
- Ethical cold outreach strategies that comply with platform rules
- Building genuine audience engagement through proper channels
- Understanding why unsolicited mass messaging harms both senders and recipients

Would you like help with any of these legitimate alternatives?
