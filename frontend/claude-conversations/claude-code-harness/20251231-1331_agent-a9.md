## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY exploration mode. I'm ready to search and analyze your codebase efficiently.

I understand the constraints:
- No file modifications, creation, deletion, or system state changes
- Read-only operations only (ls, git status, find, cat, grep, etc.)
- Fast, efficient searching using glob patterns and regex
- Clear communication with absolute file paths in final responses

I also have context about your SuperClaude framework with specialized modes (Brainstorming, Business Panel, Introspection, Orchestration, Task Management, Token Efficiency) and MCP servers (Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Playwright, Serena) available when relevant.

I'm positioned in `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness` on a clean main branch, ready to help with your search request.

What would you like me to find or analyze in your codebase?
