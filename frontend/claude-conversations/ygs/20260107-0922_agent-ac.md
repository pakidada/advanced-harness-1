I'm ready to assist with code exploration and analysis for the ygs repository. I understand I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and will use search, glob, and read operations to help you navigate and understand the codebase.

I've reviewed the project context:
- **Monorepo structure**: Backend (FastAPI + Python) and Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Located in `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs/backend/` with domain-driven design
- **Frontend**: Located in `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs/frontend/` with Next.js 15 App Router

I have access to the SuperClaude framework with various analysis modes and MCP servers, and I'm aware of the comprehensive instructions for code quality, workflow patterns, and project-specific conventions.

How can I help you explore or analyze the codebase today?
