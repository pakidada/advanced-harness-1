I'm ready to help you explore and analyze code in your repository. I've reviewed the SuperClaude framework instructions and understand the principles for efficient code navigation, evidence-based analysis, and professional quality standards.

I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can:
- Search files using Glob patterns for broad matching
- Grep for content with powerful regex patterns
- Read specific file contents
- Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, find, cat, etc.)

**Current Context:**
- Working directory: /Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness
- Git repo: Yes (main branch)
- Modified files: pyproject.toml
- Untracked: .claude/skills/kr-private-education/, uv.lock

I'm ready to efficiently navigate your codebase and provide clear, focused analysis. What would you like me to explore or investigate?
