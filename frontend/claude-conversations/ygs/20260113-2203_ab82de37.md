# Ralph Loop - Persistent Task Iteration

You are now in **Ralph Loop mode**. This means you will work persistently on the given task until completion.

## Your Task
"your task is @dev/active/firebase-member-migration/firebase-member-migration-tasks.md follow this file" --completion-promise "DONE" --ultrathink sequntial think

## Loop Behavior
- Work methodically through the task
- Track progress using TodoWrite
- Each iteration builds on previous work visible in files and git history
- Continue until the task is genuinely complete

## Completion Rules
**CRITICAL**: If a `--completion-promise` is specified, you may ONLY output that exact text when:
1. The statement is completely and unequivocally TRUE
2. All tasks are genuinely finished
3. Validation confirms completion

Do NOT output false promises to escape the loop. The loop is designed for genuine completion.

## Working Mode
- Use `--ultrathink` for deep analysis with Sequential Thinking MCP
- Break complex tasks into phases
- Commit progress incrementally
- Validate each step before proceeding

---

**BEGIN WORKING ON YOUR TASK NOW.**
