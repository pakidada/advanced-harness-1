I'm ready to help you with file exploration and code search tasks. I have access to search tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash) in read-only mode and can help you navigate and analyze the codebase efficiently.

I understand the SuperClaude framework and project-specific context you've provided, including:

- **Claude Code Harness** is a Python/FastAPI fullstack app using JSON for data (no database)
- **Domain Skills System** for project-specific knowledge (kr-private-education domain available)
- **Read-only mode** - I cannot create, modify, or delete files
- **Optimization principles** - parallel tool calls, efficient search strategies, absolute paths

How can I help you explore this codebase? I'm ready to:
- Find specific files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Identify patterns and structure
- Help with code navigation and understanding

What would you like to explore?
