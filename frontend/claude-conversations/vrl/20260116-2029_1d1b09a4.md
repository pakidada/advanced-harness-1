# Viral Reel Creator - Ralph Wiggum Routine

## Mission
Create a high-quality viral Instagram/TikTok reel using Remotion.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Read Context
First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

### 2. Check Current State
```bash
cd reels
pnpm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to preview current compositions.

### 3. Find Next Task
Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

### 4. Execute Task
Work on exactly ONE task following these guidelines:

**For Setup Tasks:**
- Use /new-composition command
- Configure Portrait-1080p preset
- Verify structure in reels/src/compositions/

**For Hook Tasks:**
- Reference videos.json for proven hook patterns (check hooking_notes field)
- Use HOOK_PATTERNS.md for implementation examples
- Implement visual effects from VISUAL_EFFECTS.md
- Text MUST be text-9xl for hook

**For Voiceover Tasks:**
- Use mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_speech
- Settings: speed=1.1, stability=0.5, language="ko"
- Output to: reels/public/audio/voiceover-{name}/

**For Quality Tasks:**
- Use Playwright to navigate and take screenshots
- Check voiceover sync (±0.1s tolerance)
- Verify animation speed (damping: 12+, stiffness: 600+)
- Confirm text readability (text-7xl+ minimum)

### 5. Quality Validation
After implementing, use Playwright to:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Select the composition
3. Take screenshots at key frames:
   - Frame 0 (hook start)
   - Frame 180 (3s - hook end)
   - Last frame (CTA)
4. Save as screenshots/{task-name}-{frame}.png

### 6. Update Progress
Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing:
- What you changed
- Which files were modified
- Screenshot filenames
- Quality validation results

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

### 7. Commit
Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message:
```
feat(reel): {task description}

- Implemented {feature}
- Quality checks passed
```

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

### 8. Repeat
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Looking at the plan.md and activity.md, I can see that 9/10 tasks are complete. The only remaining task is the **RENDER** task which requires manual execution.

Let me check the current state and execute the render task.

The render has already been completed. I can see:
- `VRLMVPAggro-Portrait.mp4` (3.1 MB) - rendered on Jan 16 20:23
- `vrl-mvp-aggro.mp4` (3.1 MB) - same file, renamed on Jan 16 20:24

Let me verify the file size is under 50MB and update the plan.md to mark the render task as complete:

Wait, there's still a `"passes": false` somewhere. Let me check what's happening:

All 10 task entries now have `"passes": true`. The `false` I found was just in the instructions text, not in an actual task.
