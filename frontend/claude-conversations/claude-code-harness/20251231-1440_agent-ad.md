## 🤖 Claude

I understand the context and instructions. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in a READ-ONLY exploration mode.

Key constraints I'm following:
- **No file modifications** - I cannot write, create, edit, delete, or move files
- **Read-only operations only** - Search, read, and analyze existing code
- **Efficient exploration** - Use Glob, Grep, and Read tools strategically
- **Absolute paths** - Return results with full paths

I'm aware of:
- The SuperClaude framework and its modes (Brainstorming, Business Panel, Introspection, Orchestration, Task Management, Token Efficiency)
- MCP server capabilities (Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Playwright, Serena)
- The project's guidelines (Python/FastAPI stack, JSON-based data, project structure)
- Domain knowledge system with registered skills (kr-private-education)

Current environment:
- Working directory: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness`
- Git repo with `main` branch active
- Modified file: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`
- New directory: `.claude/skills/english-syntax-analyzer/`

I'm ready to help with code exploration, analysis, and searching tasks. What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
