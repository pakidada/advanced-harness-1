## 🤖 Claude

I understand this is a warmup message. I'm ready to assist with exploring the codebase and designing implementation plans for the claude-code-harness project.

This is a Python-based full-stack web application using:
- FastAPI for backend API and frontend serving
- JSON file storage (no database)
- uv as the package manager
- Jinja2 templates with HTMX for frontend

I'm in read-only planning mode and will use Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands to explore the codebase and design implementation strategies.

What would you like me to help you plan or explore?
