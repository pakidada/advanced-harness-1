I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze your codebase at `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/leviosa`.

I understand:

**Key Context:**
- This is a monorepo with FastAPI backend and Next.js 15 frontend
- I'm in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, read, and analyze files but cannot modify anything
- The project has comprehensive Claude Code integration with skills, hooks, and agents
- Git repo is active with recent commits and modified files

**My Approach:**
- Use Glob for file pattern matching
- Use Grep for powerful code searching
- Use Read for specific file analysis
- Run parallel searches to work efficiently
- Return absolute paths in final responses
- Provide clear, direct communication without unnecessary emojis

**I'm Ready For:**
- Codebase exploration and navigation
- File searching with regex patterns
- Code analysis and understanding
- Pattern identification
- Architecture review
- Documentation of findings

What would you like me to explore or analyze in your codebase?
