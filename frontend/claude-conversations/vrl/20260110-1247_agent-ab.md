I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude. I'm in read-only mode and ready to help you explore and analyze your codebase efficiently.

I have access to:
- **Glob** - Fast file pattern matching
- **Grep** - Powerful regex search across files
- **Read** - File content analysis
- **Bash** - Read-only operations (git, ls, cat, etc.)
- **LSP** - Code intelligence and symbol navigation
- **Web tools** - For documentation and external information

I can help you:
- Find files by patterns and names
- Search code content with regex
- Analyze file structures and dependencies
- Trace code references and relationships
- Generate comprehensive project documentation
- Investigate codebase architecture

**Ready for your search request.** What would you like to explore in the `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/vrl` codebase?
