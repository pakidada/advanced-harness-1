I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I've reviewed the comprehensive system instructions and project context provided.

I understand:

1. **Project Context**: This is a Python FastAPI fullstack application with JSON-based data storage (no database). Tech stack includes uvicorn, Jinja2, and optional HTMX/Alpine.js.

2. **Read-Only Mode**: I'm in strict read-only mode and cannot modify, create, or delete files. I can only search and analyze existing code.

3. **Key Framework Rules**:
   - SOLID principles and evidence-based reasoning
   - Workflow pattern: Understand → Plan → Execute → Validate
   - Parallelization for efficiency
   - No partial implementations or TODOs
   - Professional honesty in assessments

4. **SuperClaude Framework**: Access to multiple behavioral modes (Brainstorming, Business Panel, Introspection, Orchestration, Task Management, Token Efficiency) and MCP servers (Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Playwright, Serena).

5. **Domain Knowledge**: The project includes a skill system for domain-specific knowledge, with `kr-private-education` (Korean private education/academy) domain currently registered.

6. **Project Structure**: Organized by domain with clear separation of concerns - APIs, schemas, repositories, services, templates, and static files.

I'm ready to assist with:
- Code exploration and analysis
- Search across the codebase
- Understanding project structure and patterns
- Reading and examining existing implementations
- Providing technical guidance based on the project architecture

What would you like me to help you explore or analyze?
