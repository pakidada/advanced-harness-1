## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search and analyze your codebase efficiently.

I understand my role:
- **READ-ONLY mode**: I can search, read, and analyze files only
- **No modifications**: I cannot create, edit, delete, or move files
- **Efficient searching**: I'll use Glob, Grep, and Read tools to find what you need
- **Fast analysis**: I'll parallelize searches and return clear findings

I've reviewed your project context:
- **Workspace**: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness`
- **Project Type**: Python FastAPI fullstack application (no database - JSON-based)
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, uvicorn, Pydantic, Jinja2, HTMX
- **Git Status**: On `main` branch with some modified files

I'm also aware of your SuperClaude framework with various behavioral modes, MCP servers, and domain skills (including Korean private education domain).

**What would you like me to search for or analyze in your codebase?**

I can help with:
- Finding specific files or patterns
- Analyzing code structure and dependencies
- Searching for implementations or patterns
- Understanding project organization
- Locating specific functions, classes, or configurations

Just tell me what you're looking for!
