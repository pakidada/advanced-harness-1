I'll help you create a viral reel. Let me first read the plan and activity files to understand the current state, then execute the tasks.

Based on the plan, I can see that **Task 2 (Images)** has `passes: false` - all other tasks are completed. However, the images already exist. Let me check the images to see if they need to be regenerated, and also verify the composition is properly registered in Root.tsx:

I see the issue. The current **hook.jpg** image is a cute, friendly-looking Pepper robot - **not** the threatening, ominous AI robot with glowing red eyes required for the "어그로" viral style. The plan says Task 2 `passes: false` because the images need to be regenerated with proper Nano Banana Pro prompts.

Let me check all the current images to confirm they need regeneration:

The current images are completely wrong for the viral reel:
- **hook.jpg**: Friendly Pepper robot (needs: ominous AI with red glowing eyes)
- **problem.jpg**: Stressed person (okay-ish, but not cyberpunk/neon style)
- **solution.jpg**: Portrait of a person (needs: AI collaboration scene)
- **proof.jpg**: Empty office corridor (needs: 10X productivity dashboard)
- **cta.jpg**: AI text graphic (needs: social media energy burst)

I need to regenerate all 5 images using Nano Banana Pro with the correct prompts. Let me create the activity file and start the image generation.

Now let me check if there's a Replicate MCP tool available for image generation:

There's a Replicate MCP configured. Let me check if I can access its tools through the available MCP functions. Let me search for replicate-related MCP tools:

Looking at my available tools, I don't see a `mcp__replicate__generate_image` tool in my function list. The PROMPT.md mentions this tool but it may not be connected. Let me check if there's a way to generate images via another method or if I should use WebFetch with Replicate's API:

Let me try calling the Replicate MCP directly. The PROMPT.md mentions `mcp__replicate__generate_image` but looking at my available tools, I don't see it listed. Let me try using Bash to call the Replicate API directly:

The network request may have failed due to sandbox restrictions. Let me provide the prompts to you and you can generate them, or I can update the activity log with the prompts needed:

## Summary

I've analyzed the plan and found that **Task 2 (Image Generation)** is the only task with `passes: false`. The current images are stock photos, not the AI-generated viral-style images required.

### Current Issue
The Replicate MCP for Nano Banana Pro image generation isn't connected in this session.

### What's Needed
Generate 5 images using **Nano Banana Pro** (`fofr/nano-banana-pro`) with **9:16 aspect ratio**:

| Image | Description | Prompt |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **hook.jpg** | 위협적 AI 로봇 | `Ominous humanoid AI robot with glowing red eyes emerging from shadows, dark office background, neon pink and red lighting, threatening atmosphere, cinematic wide shot, dramatic contrast, empty space at top for text, vertical composition 9:16, photorealistic, 8k` |
| **problem.jpg** | 일자리 위기 공포 | `Desperate office worker with head in hands, computer screens showing TERMINATED and AI icons, red emergency lighting, papers flying, dystopian corporate atmosphere, emotional despair, dark moody lighting, vertical 9:16, space for text overlay, cinematic` |
| **solution.jpg** | AI 협력 희망 | `Confident young professional smiling while working with holographic AI interface, warm golden and cyan neon lighting, futuristic but friendly workspace, optimistic mood, success energy, bright atmosphere, vertical 9:16, text space at center, inspiring` |
| **proof.jpg** | 10배 생산성 | `Futuristic productivity dashboard floating in air showing 10X growth charts, green glowing metrics, person celebrating success in background, neon lime and gold accents, achievement visualization, vertical 9:16, modern tech aesthetic, motivational` |
| **cta.jpg** | 팔로우 에너지 | `Abstract social media energy burst with glowing follow icons and upward arrows, neon pink and lime green gradient explosion, dynamic motion blur, dark background with light streaks, call to action energy, vertical 9:16, vibrant and urgent` |

### Save Location
`reels/public/images/ai-chaos/`

### After Image Generation
Run the render script:
```bash
./ralph/reels-creator/render.sh AIChaosViral portrait
```

Would you like me to:
1. Try an alternative image generation method?
2. Proceed with current images for a test render first?
3. Wait for you to generate the images manually?
