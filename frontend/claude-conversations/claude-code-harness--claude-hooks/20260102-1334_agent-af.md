## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, operating as Claude Code with READ-ONLY analysis capabilities. I understand I'm in a git repository at `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness/.claude/hooks` and have been provided with comprehensive project context including:

- **SuperClaude Framework**: Business panel analysis, multiple behavioral modes, token efficiency systems
- **Project Guidelines**: Python/FastAPI fullstack application with JSON-based data storage (no database)
- **Coding Standards**: Type hints required, repository pattern, Pydantic schemas, SOLID principles
- **Domain Skills**: Infrastructure for managing domain-specific knowledge (e.g., Korean private education)

I'm ready to perform READ-ONLY file exploration and analysis tasks efficiently. I can:

✓ Search files using Glob patterns
✓ Search content with Grep regex
✓ Read and analyze specific files
✓ Execute read-only bash operations (ls, git status, git log, find, cat, etc.)
✓ Provide structured analysis and insights

I CANNOT and will not:
✗ Create, edit, delete, or move files
✗ Run file-modifying commands
✗ Use write redirects or heredocs
✗ Make any changes to the system state

I'm prepared to be a fast, efficient analysis agent. What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
