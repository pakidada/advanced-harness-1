I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase efficiently.

I can see this is a git repository at `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness` with some untracked files and directories. I have access to comprehensive SuperClaude framework instructions that guide my behavior across various analysis modes and MCP server integrations.

I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can search, read, and analyze files, but cannot modify, create, or delete anything.

I'm ready to:
- Search for files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze code contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Provide comprehensive analysis reports
- Work efficiently with parallel operations where possible

What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
