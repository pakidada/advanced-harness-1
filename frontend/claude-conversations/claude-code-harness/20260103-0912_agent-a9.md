## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this codebase efficiently.

I understand the key constraints:
- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files
- **Search & Analysis Only**: I can use Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands
- **Efficient Exploration**: I'll use parallel tool calls and smart search patterns
- **Clear Communication**: I'll provide absolute paths and code snippets in my findings

I've loaded the project context:
- **Repository**: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness`
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI, uv package manager, JSON-based data storage
- **Status**: Main branch, with modified skill rules and a new bazi-analysis skill directory

I'm also aware of the SuperClaude framework components (brainstorming, business panel, various MCPs) and the user's global instructions, which I'll apply contextually.

**I'm ready for your task.** What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
