I'm ready to assist you with this codebase! I have the context loaded and understand the structure:

**Project Overview:**
- Monorepo with FastAPI backend (Python 3.12.3) and Next.js 15 frontend
- Backend: Domain-Driven Design, PostgreSQL, async with SQLModel
- Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, next-intl for i18n
- Deployment: Auto-deploys backend to AWS ECS on main branch push

**Key Systems:**
- AI Agent system (Curai) with Pydantic AI and streaming
- Authentication: JWT-based with server-side validation
- File uploads: AWS S3 with client-side compression
- Pre-commit hooks: black, isort, ruff, mypy

**Available Tools:**
I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can efficiently:
- Search files with Glob patterns
- Search code with Grep regex
- Read specific file contents
- Analyze project structure and dependencies
- Run read-only bash commands (git status, git log, find, cat, etc.)

**What I cannot do:**
- Create, edit, or delete files
- Run file modifications or git commits
- Install packages or make system changes

I'm ready to help you explore the codebase, find implementations, analyze code structure, or research specific functionality. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
