We're approaching context limits. Please update the development documentation to ensure seamless continuation after context reset.

## Required Updates

### 1. Update Active Task Documentation
For each task in `/dev/active/`:
- Update `[task-name]-context.md` with:
  - Current implementation state
  - Key decisions made this session
  - Files modified and why
  - Any blockers or issues discovered
  - Next immediate steps
  - Last Updated timestamp

- Update `[task-name]-tasks.md` with:
  - Mark completed tasks as ✅ 
  - Add any new tasks discovered
  - Update in-progress tasks with current status
  - Reorder priorities if needed

### 2. Capture Session Context
Include any relevant information about:
- Complex problems solved
- Architectural decisions made
- Tricky bugs found and fixed
- Integration points discovered
- Testing approaches used
- Performance optimizations made

### 3. Update Memory (if applicable)
- Store any new patterns or solutions in project memory/documentation
- Update entity relationships discovered
- Add observations about system behavior

### 4. Document Unfinished Work
- What was being worked on when context limit approached
- Exact state of any partially completed features
- Commands that need to be run on restart
- Any temporary workarounds that need permanent fixes

### 5. Create Handoff Notes
If switching to a new conversation:
- Exact file and line being edited
- The goal of current changes
- Any uncommitted changes that need attention
- Test commands to verify work

## Additional Context: $ARGUMENTS

**Priority**: Focus on capturing information that would be hard to rediscover or reconstruct from code alone.

I'll analyze the current session context and update the development documentation. Let me first check what's in the `/dev/` directory and understand the current state.

Now let me check if there's any recent implementation work that's been done but not documented. Let me look at recently modified backend files:

## Documentation Update Complete

I've updated all development documentation for seamless continuation after context reset:

### Updated Files

1. **`dev/active/firebase-member-migration/firebase-member-migration-context.md`**
   - Updated status to Phase 1-2 Complete, Phase 3 Partially Complete (~69%)
   - Documented all completed implementation (backend domain, API, DTOs)
   - Added migration state: 107/183 users migrated
   - Added key decisions made this session
   - Clear next steps for resuming

2. **`dev/active/firebase-member-migration/firebase-member-migration-tasks.md`**
   - Marked ~20 tasks complete with checkboxes
   - Updated progress summary
   - Added critical path for next session with exact commands
   - Documented discoveries during implementation

3. **`dev/active/kakao-login/kakao-login-context.md`**
   - Clarified this is SECONDARY priority (after migration)
   - Noted backend auth infrastructure already exists
   - Updated with relationship to migration task

4. **`dev/active/firebase-social-auth/firebase-social-auth-context.md`**
   - Clarified this is TERTIARY priority
   - Documented what's already implemented from migration
   - Updated dependencies list

5. **`dev/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-01-13.md`** (NEW)
   - Exact state when context limit hit
   - Immediate next action command
   - All completed work this session
   - Task priority order
   - Uncommitted changes list
   - Environment setup commands
   - Verification commands

### Critical Information for Next Session

**Immediate Action**:
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python -c "from backend.scripts.migration import run_migration; run_migration()"
```

This resumes user migration from checkpoint (user #108 of ~183).
