We're approaching context limits. Please update the development documentation to ensure seamless continuation after context reset.

## Required Updates

### 1. Update Active Task Documentation
For each task in `/dev/active/`:
- Update `[task-name]-context.md` with:
  - Current implementation state
  - Key decisions made this session
  - Files modified and why
  - Any blockers or issues discovered
  - Next immediate steps
  - Last Updated timestamp

- Update `[task-name]-tasks.md` with:
  - Mark completed tasks as ✅ 
  - Add any new tasks discovered
  - Update in-progress tasks with current status
  - Reorder priorities if needed

### 2. Capture Session Context
Include any relevant information about:
- Complex problems solved
- Architectural decisions made
- Tricky bugs found and fixed
- Integration points discovered
- Testing approaches used
- Performance optimizations made

### 3. Update Memory (if applicable)
- Store any new patterns or solutions in project memory/documentation
- Update entity relationships discovered
- Add observations about system behavior

### 4. Document Unfinished Work
- What was being worked on when context limit approached
- Exact state of any partially completed features
- Commands that need to be run on restart
- Any temporary workarounds that need permanent fixes

### 5. Create Handoff Notes
If switching to a new conversation:
- Exact file and line being edited
- The goal of current changes
- Any uncommitted changes that need attention
- Test commands to verify work

## Additional Context: $ARGUMENTS

**Priority**: Focus on capturing information that would be hard to rediscover or reconstruct from code alone.

I'll update the development documentation to capture the current state before context reset. Let me first examine the current state of active tasks and recent work.
