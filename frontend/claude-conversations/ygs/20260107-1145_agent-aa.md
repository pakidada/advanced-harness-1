I'm ready to help you search and analyze code in this repository. I understand:

**Current Environment:**
- Working directory: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/ygs`
- Git repo on `main` branch
- Monorepo with `backend/` (FastAPI) and `frontend/` (Next.js)

**My Role:**
- Read-only code exploration and analysis
- Fast, efficient file discovery using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
- Parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Report findings with absolute file paths and relevant code snippets

**Key Project Context:**
- Backend: Python FastAPI with PostgreSQL, domain-driven design
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Domain structure in backend: `backend/domain/{entity}/`
- Frontend structure: components, hooks, lib utilities, types

I'm prepared to help with code search requests, architectural analysis, pattern identification, or any codebase exploration needs. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
