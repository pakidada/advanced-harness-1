I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and analyze this codebase. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode with a focus on efficient file exploration.

I can see this is a monorepo with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.12.3, domain-driven design architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

I have access to powerful search tools:
- **Glob** for file pattern matching
- **Grep** for content searching with regex
- **Read** for analyzing specific files
- **Bash** for read-only operations

I'm ready to help you explore the codebase, search for implementations, analyze code patterns, or answer questions about the project structure. What would you like me to find or analyze?
