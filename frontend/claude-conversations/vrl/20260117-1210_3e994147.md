I've read the PROMPT.md file. This is an AI viral reels generation agent system. Let me read the required context files to understand the current state and find the first task that needs to be completed.

I've reviewed the context files. According to the plan:
- Task 0 (reference analysis): ✅ passes: true
- Task 1 (script): ✅ passes: true
- **Task 2 (images): ❌ passes: false** ← First incomplete task

Task 2 requires generating 5 images using Replicate Nano Banana Pro for each segment (Hook, Problem, Solution, Proof, CTA).

Let me check what MCP tools are available and the current state of the images directory.

I can see there are already some images in the directory, but according to the plan, Task 2 requires generating NEW images using Replicate Nano Banana Pro MCP. The plan explicitly states: "⚠️ 절대 기존 이미지 복사 금지. 반드시 Nano Banana Pro로 새로 생성할 것"

However, I notice that **Replicate MCP is not available** in my current tool list. The PROMPT.md mentions `mcp__replicate__generate_image` but this tool is not available in my current environment.

Let me check what MCP tools I have available and inform you of the situation.

I need to inform you about a blocker:

**🚨 Task 2 Blocker: Replicate MCP Not Available**

The plan requires using `mcp__replicate__generate_image` (Nano Banana Pro model) to generate 5 images, but this MCP tool is not available in my current environment.

Available MCP servers I can see:
- ✅ ElevenLabs (text_to_speech, text_to_sound_effects)
- ✅ Gemini Video (analyze_design_video)
- ✅ Playwright (browser automation)
- ✅ Context7, Magic, Sequential Thinking
- ❌ **Replicate MCP** - NOT AVAILABLE

**Options to proceed:**

1. **Skip Task 2**: Use existing images in `reels/public/images/ai-chaos/` and proceed to Task 3 (voiceover generation)

2. **Wait**: You configure the Replicate MCP server and I retry Task 2

3. **Alternative Image Generation**: If you have another image generation method available

Which option would you prefer? In the meantime, I can start working on **Task 3 (ElevenLabs voiceover)** and **Task 4 (SFX)** in parallel since ElevenLabs MCP is available.
