I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file exploration and codebase analysis. I'm in read-only mode and can efficiently search and analyze your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read.

I've reviewed your environment and project context:
- Working directory: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness`
- Git repo on main branch with recent changes to skill rules and a new English syntax analyzer skill
- Python FastAPI project using JSON-based data storage with uv package manager
- Domain skill system active for knowledge management

I'm ready to help you explore and understand your codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
