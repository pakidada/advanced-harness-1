### README.md (12 lines → 339 lines)
Complete rewrite with:
- **Project overview** - Clear description of the premium matchmaking platform
- **Features list** - User features (auth, matching, profiles) and admin features (dashboard, management)
- **Tech stack breakdown** - Backend and frontend technologies
- **Setup instructions** - Step-by-step for both backend and frontend
