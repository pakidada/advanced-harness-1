# Viral Reel Creator - Ralph Wiggum Routine

## Mission
Create a high-quality viral Instagram/TikTok reel using Remotion.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Read Context
First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

### 2. Check Current State
```bash
cd reels
pnpm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to preview current compositions.

### 3. Find Next Task
Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

### 4. Execute Task
Work on exactly ONE task following these guidelines:

**For Setup Tasks:**
- Use /new-composition command
- Configure Portrait-1080p preset
- Verify structure in reels/src/compositions/

**For Hook Tasks:**
- Reference videos.json for proven hook patterns (check hooking_notes field)
- Use HOOK_PATTERNS.md for implementation examples
- Implement visual effects from VISUAL_EFFECTS.md
- Text MUST be text-9xl for hook

**For Voiceover Tasks:**
- Use mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_speech
- Settings: speed=1.1, stability=0.5, language="ko"
- Output to: reels/public/audio/voiceover-{name}/

**For Quality Tasks:**
- Use Playwright to navigate and take screenshots
- Check voiceover sync (±0.1s tolerance)
- Verify animation speed (damping: 12+, stiffness: 600+)
- Confirm text readability (text-7xl+ minimum)

### 5. Quality Validation
After implementing, use Playwright to:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Select the composition
3. Take screenshots at key frames:
   - Frame 0 (hook start)
   - Frame 180 (3s - hook end)
   - Last frame (CTA)
4. Save as screenshots/{task-name}-{frame}.png

### 6. Update Progress
Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing:
- What you changed
- Which files were modified
- Screenshot filenames
- Quality validation results

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

### 7. Commit
Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message:
```
feat(reel): {task description}

- Implemented {feature}
- Quality checks passed
```

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

### 8. Repeat
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

I'll start by reading the activity.md to understand the current state, then check what compositions already exist.

I can see there's already a `vrl-mvp-aggro` composition. Let me read the current state of the composition and check what voiceover files exist.

The composition already exists with voiceover files. Now I need to check what audio files the composition expects vs what actually exists, and see if there's a sfx folder.

I see there's a mismatch between what the composition expects and what exists. The composition references:
- `audio/voiceover-vrl-mvp/hook.mp3`, `problem.mp3`, `twist.mp3`, etc.
- `audio/sfx-vrl-mvp/boom.mp3`, `cash.mp3`, `reject.mp3`, `magic.mp3`, `ding.mp3`, `whoosh.mp3`

But the actual files have different names. Let me update the plan.md to mark the first task (setup) as complete since the composition exists, and focus on fixing the voiceover/sfx file naming issue.

Now I need to generate the missing SFX files and rename/organize them. The composition needs: boom.mp3, cash.mp3, reject.mp3, magic.mp3, ding.mp3, whoosh.mp3

Looking at what we have:
- `sfx_drama_20260116_200417.mp3` → could be boom
- `sfx_money_20260116_200419.mp3` → should be cash
- `sfx_error_20260116_200421.mp3` → could be reject
- `sfx_magic_20260116_200423.mp3` → should be magic

We're missing: ding.mp3, whoosh.mp3

Let me generate the missing SFX and then organize all files.
