# Viral Reel Creator - Ralph Wiggum Routine

## Mission
Create a high-quality viral Instagram/TikTok reel using Remotion.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Read Context
First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

### 2. Check Current State
```bash
cd reels
pnpm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to preview current compositions.

### 3. Find Next Task
Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

### 4. Execute Task
Work on exactly ONE task following these guidelines:

**For Setup Tasks:**
- Use /new-composition command
- Configure Portrait-1080p preset
- Verify structure in reels/src/compositions/

**For Hook Tasks:**
- Reference videos.json for proven hook patterns (check hooking_notes field)
- Use HOOK_PATTERNS.md for implementation examples
- Implement visual effects from VISUAL_EFFECTS.md
- Text MUST be text-9xl for hook

**For Voiceover Tasks:**
- Use mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_speech
- Settings: speed=1.1, stability=0.5, language="ko"
- Output to: reels/public/audio/voiceover-{name}/

**For Quality Tasks:**
- Use Playwright to navigate and take screenshots
- Check voiceover sync (±0.1s tolerance)
- Verify animation speed (damping: 12+, stiffness: 600+)
- Confirm text readability (text-7xl+ minimum)

### 5. Quality Validation
After implementing, use Playwright to:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Select the composition
3. Take screenshots at key frames:
   - Frame 0 (hook start)
   - Frame 180 (3s - hook end)
   - Last frame (CTA)
4. Save as screenshots/{task-name}-{frame}.png

### 6. Update Progress
Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing:
- What you changed
- Which files were modified
- Screenshot filenames
- Quality validation results

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

### 7. Commit
Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message:
```
feat(reel): {task description}

- Implemented {feature}
- Quality checks passed
```

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

### 8. Repeat
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

I'll start by reading the activity.md to understand the current state, then check what tasks need to be done.

Based on the files I've already read:
- **plan.md**: Shows 10 tasks, all with `"passes": false` - meaning none have been completed yet
- **activity.md**: Shows 0/10 tasks completed, current task "Not started"

The first task to tackle is the **setup** task: "Create new composition with Portrait-1080p preset"

Let me first check the current state of the reels directory and start the dev server to understand what exists.

I can see there are already several compositions in the reels project. Let me examine the existing structure to understand the patterns used, and also check the vrl-mvp-aggro composition which seems to be the most recent one.

Let me read the vrl-mvp-aggro Composition.tsx to understand the structure, and check if the composition is registered in Root.tsx.

I notice that the `vrl-mvp-aggro` composition exists but is NOT registered in Root.tsx. This is a task that needs to be completed. Let me now update my task tracking and work on the first task.

Now let me check if the audio files exist for the vrl-mvp-aggro composition:

## 🤖 Claude

The audio files for vrl-mvp-aggro are NOT present. The composition references:
- `audio/voiceover-vrl-mvp/hook.mp3`
- `audio/sfx-vrl-mvp/boom.mp3`
- etc.

But these don't exist. This is a critical issue - the composition needs audio files generated.

Let me check what the exact audio files the composition needs:

## 🤖 Claude

The vrl-mvp-aggro composition needs these audio files:

**Voiceovers needed:**
1. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/hook.mp3` - "개발자한테 견적 받아봄?"
2. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/problem.mp3` - "3개월, 수천만원"
3. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/twist.mp3` - "그거 다 필요 없어"
4. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/solution.mp3` - "AI가 3일 만에 만들어줌"
5. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/proof.mp3` - "진짜 이렇게 나와"
6. `voiceover-vrl-mvp/cta.mp3` - "방법 알고 싶으면 VRL 검색"

**SFX needed:**
1. `sfx-vrl-mvp/boom.mp3` - dramatic impact
2. `sfx-vrl-mvp/cash.mp3` - money/cash sound
3. `sfx-vrl-mvp/reject.mp3` - rejection sound
4. `sfx-vrl-mvp/magic.mp3` - magical transformation
5. `sfx-vrl-mvp/ding.mp3` - success/achievement
6. `sfx-vrl-mvp/whoosh.mp3` - transition

The first priority is completing the **setup** task. Since the composition exists but isn't registered, and the audio files are missing, I need to:

1. Register the composition in Root.tsx
2. Generate the missing audio files using ElevenLabs

Let me start by registering the composition in Root.tsx:

The composition is already registered in Root.tsx (lines 33 and 116-119). The import is there and the folder is included in the JSX.

Now I need to create the audio files. Let me create the directories first and then generate the audio files using ElevenLabs MCP.

Now let me generate the voiceovers using ElevenLabs. First, let me search for a Korean-friendly voice:

I see that I need permission to use ElevenLabs. Let me update the task status and continue with verifying what we can do without the audio files first.

I need permission to use ElevenLabs. Let me try a different approach - I'll list voices to see what's available:

It seems ElevenLabs MCP tools require permission. Let me proceed with generating the audio files - I'll need to use text_to_speech directly:

I need permission for ElevenLabs tools. While waiting for permission, let me start the dev server to see the current state of the composition and verify what we have.
