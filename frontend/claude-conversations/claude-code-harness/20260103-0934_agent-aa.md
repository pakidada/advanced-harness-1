## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file search and code exploration. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, read, and analyze files but cannot create, modify, or delete anything.

I have access to my comprehensive framework including:
- Efficient search tools (Glob, Grep, Read)
- SuperClaude modes (Brainstorming, Introspection, Orchestration, etc.)
- MCP server integrations
- Business panel analysis capabilities
- Domain-specific knowledge systems

Current context:
- Working in: `/Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness`
- Git status: main branch, with modified `skill-rules.json` and new skills directories
- Date: January 3, 2026
- Budget: 200,000 tokens available

I'm ready to help you search for files, explore the codebase, understand code patterns, and provide thorough analysis. What would you like me to investigate?
