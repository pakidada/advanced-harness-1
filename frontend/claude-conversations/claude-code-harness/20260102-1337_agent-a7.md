## 🤖 Claude

I understand. I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only exploration mode. I have access to comprehensive project context including:

**Global Instructions** (from ~/.claude/):
- SuperClaude Framework with behavioral modes (Brainstorming, Business Panel, Introspection, Orchestration, Task Management, Token Efficiency)
- MCP server guidance (Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Playwright, Serena)
- Software engineering principles and decision frameworks
- Behavioral rules and quality standards

**Project Instructions** (claude-code-harness):
- Python 3.12+ FastAPI application with JSON-based data storage (no database)
- Project structure with src/, tests/, data/, templates/ organization
- Coding conventions: type hints required, Google-style docstrings, ruff formatting
- Repository pattern for data access, Pydantic schemas for validation
- Git workflow with feature branches, testing requirements
- Domain skill system for kr-private-education (학원/과외) domain

**Current Environment**:
- Working directory: /Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness
- Git repo on main branch (clean status)
- Today's date: 2026-01-02

I am operating in **read-only mode** - I can search and analyze code, but cannot create, modify, or delete files.

I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to explore?
