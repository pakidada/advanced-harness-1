## Executive Summary

Naver SmartStore employs **aggressive multi-layered bot detection** that is specifically designed to break crawlers. Your error "[에러] 에러페이지 - 시스템오류" is a classic bot detection response. Based on extensive research, here are the key findings:

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Naver's Bot Detection Methods

**Primary Detection Techniques:**
- **IP-based blocking**: [Naver actively blocks traffic from known datacenter IP ranges](https://scrape.do/blog/naver-scraping/) (AWS, GCP, commercial proxies)
- **Browser fingerprinting**: Canvas, WebGL, TLS fingerprints, navigator properties
- **Behavioral analysis**: Click intervals, scroll pacing, cookie aging, cursor behavior, session entropy tracking
- **Session validation**: Multi-step authentication, regional locks, session timers
- **JavaScript challenges**: Multi-layered challenges tied to region and session behavior
- **CDP detection**: [Detection of Chrome Developer Protocol usage](https://substack.thewebscraping.club/p/playwright-stealth-cdp) - the protocol Playwright uses

**Key Insight**: [Naver doesn't just check if you're a bot—it tests if you behave like a real user inside a Korean browser session](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver). Even well-configured headless browsers fail without the right IP and session setup.

### 2. Why Your Current Approach is Failing

Based on the error, you're likely hitting these issues:

1. **Datacenter IP detection**: If scraping from cloud servers, instant block
2. **Missing browser fingerprints**: Playwright's default configuration exposes automation markers
3. **Headless detection**: Standard headless mode is easily detected
4. **Session behavior**: No human-like scrolling, timing, or interaction patterns
5. **Geographic restriction**: Non-Korean IP addresses are heavily scrutinized

### 3. Proven Bypass Techniques (Ranked by Effectiveness)

#### **Tier 1: Most Effective (but challenging)**

**A. Residential Korean Proxies + Advanced Stealth**
- [Use residential proxies with Korean geolocation](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver) - CRITICAL for Naver
- Premium proxy routing is especially important where regular IPs get blocked fast
- Combine with session emulation (see below)

**B. Next-Generation Stealth Libraries**

1. **Nodriver** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver))
   - [Successor to Undetected-Chromedriver](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/nodriver-tutorial/)
   - [Communicates directly via Chrome DevTools Protocol without Selenium/ChromeDriver binaries](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/nodriver)
   - [Significantly harder for anti-bot systems to detect](https://roundproxies.com/blog/how-to-use-nodriver-for-web-scraping-in-7-steps/)
   - Fully asynchronous, better WAF resistance
   - **Limitation**: [Still has bugs, doesn't fully support proxies or headless mode](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/undetected-chromedriver-alternatives)

2. **Botasaurus** ([GitHub](https://github.com/omkarcloud/botasaurus-vs-undetected-chromedriver-vs-puppeteer-stealth-benchmarks))
   - [Designed specifically to bypass sophisticated anti-bot systems](https://scrape.do/blog/naver-scraping/)
   - [Real browser fingerprints, human-like behavior, automatic user-agent rotation](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/botasaurus)
   - [60-85% success rate against enterprise-grade protection](https://scrapingant.com/blog/open-source-web-scraping-libraries-bypass-anti-bot)
   - **Limitation**: [Almost useless on server environments - datacenter IPs easily blocked](https://roundproxies.com/blog/botasaurus/)

**C. Session Emulation Strategy**
- [Naver tracks session realism: click intervals, scroll pacing, cookie aging, cursor behavior](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver)
- **Key principle**: [Bots that mimic humans outperform bots that try to dodge detection](https://groupbwt.com/blog/how-to-scrape-data-from-naver/)
- Implement random delays, realistic scrolling, mouse movements

#### **Tier 2: Standard Stealth Plugins (Limited Effectiveness)**

**Playwright-Stealth** ([Python](https://github.com/Granitosaurus/playwright-stealth) | [JS](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra))
- [Patches many bot detection signals automatically](https://brightdata.com/blog/how-tos/avoid-bot-detection-with-playwright-stealth)
- Removes navigator.webdriver, fakes plugins, injects WebGL noise
- **Major limitation**: [Still detected by Cloudflare and advanced anti-bot systems](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/avoid-playwright-bot-detection)
- [Known issue: Playwright stealth fails Cloudflare challenges that Puppeteer stealth passes](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/793)
- [Works for basic testing but detected by advanced fingerprinting](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/avoid-bot-detection)

#### **Tier 3: API-Based Approach (Recommended Alternative)**

**Naver Internal API Scraping**
- [With channelUid and productNo values, you can hit Naver's internal API](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver)
- Append `withWindow=false` for lighter JSON response
- Bypasses rendering entirely - more reliable than browser automation

### 4. Implementation Recommendations

#### **Option A: Quick Fix (Playwright Improvements)**

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from playwright_stealth import stealth_async

async with async_playwright() as p:
    browser = await p.chromium.launch(
        headless=False,  # Run in headed mode initially
        args=[
            '--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled',
            '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
            '--disable-web-security',
            '--disable-features=IsolateOrigins,site-per-process',
        ]
    )
    
    context = await browser.new_context(
        viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},
        user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
        locale='ko-KR',
        timezone_id='Asia/Seoul',
        # CRITICAL: Use Korean residential proxy
        proxy={
            'server': 'YOUR_KOREAN_RESIDENTIAL_PROXY',
        }
    )
    
    page = await context.new_page()
    await stealth_async(page)  # Apply stealth patches
    
    # Human-like navigation
    await page.goto(url, wait_until='networkidle')
    await page.wait_for_timeout(random.randint(2000, 5000))
    
    # Scroll to trigger lazy loading
    await page.evaluate('window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight/2)')
    await page.wait_for_timeout(random.randint(1000, 3000))
    
    # Wait for images
    await page.wait_for_load_state('load')
```

**Critical additions needed:**
1. [Korean residential proxy with geolocation](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver) - NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. [Realistic browser headers matching Korean Chrome](https://scrapfly.io/blog/posts/how-to-scrape-naver)
3. [UTF-8 encoding for Korean text](https://groupbwt.com/blog/how-to-scrape-data-from-naver/)
4. Random delays and human-like behavior
5. Cookie persistence across sessions

#### **Option B: Switch to Nodriver (Higher Success Rate)**

```python
import nodriver as uc
import asyncio

async def scrape_naver(url):
    browser = await uc.start(
        headless=False,
        # Add proxy configuration when support improves
    )
    
    page = await browser.get(url)
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Human delay
    
    # Scroll and wait
    await page.scroll_down(100)
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    
    content = await page.get_content()
    return content
```

#### **Option C: GitHub Reference Implementations**

1. **[RecoRecoNi/naver-smartstore-crawling](https://github.com/RecoRecoNi/naver-smartstore-crawling)** - Coffee review scraper (check their approach)
2. **[pincoin/smartstore-automate](https://github.com/pincoin/smartstore-automate)** - Automation tool with ChromeDriver config

### 5. Critical Configuration Checklist

**Headers:**
```python
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8',
    'Accept-Language': 'ko-KR,ko;q=0.9,en;q=0.8',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    'Referer': 'https://www.naver.com/',
    'DNT': '1',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests': '1',
}
```

**Playwright Context Settings:**
```python
context_options = {
    'viewport': {'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},
    'locale': 'ko-KR',
    'timezone_id': 'Asia/Seoul',
    'color_scheme': 'light',
    'user_agent': '<Korean Chrome UA>',
    'java_script_enabled': True,
    'bypass_csp': False,  # Keep CSP enabled for realism
}
```

**Wait Strategies:**
- [Use `page.wait_for_load_state('load')` for images and stylesheets](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/playwright-waitforloadstate)
- [Consider `networkidle` for dynamic content](https://autify.com/blog/playwright-wait-for-page-to-load) (not recommended by Playwright but useful for heavy JS sites)
- [Use `page.wait_for_selector()` for specific image elements](https://scrapfly.io/blog/answers/how-to-wait-for-page-to-load-in-playwright)
