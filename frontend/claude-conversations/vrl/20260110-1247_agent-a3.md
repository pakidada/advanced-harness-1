I'll start by exploring the project structure to understand what we're working with.

I understand - this was a warmup request to initialize the tools. The tools are now ready for use.

This is a **monorepo** project containing:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PostgreSQL (Python 3.12.3)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation, the project follows:
- Domain-Driven Design in the backend with entities like `user`, `auth`, `artist`, `artwork`, `admin`, `curai`, `exhibition`, `message`, `notification`, `subscription`
- App Router pattern in Next.js 15 frontend
- JWT-based authentication
- AWS S3 for image uploads
- Chrome DevTools MCP for browser testing

The tools are now warmed up and ready. What would you like me to explore or plan?
