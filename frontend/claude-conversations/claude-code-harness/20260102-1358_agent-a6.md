I'm ready to assist you with code exploration and analysis tasks. I'm operating in read-only mode and can efficiently search and navigate this codebase using:

- **Glob**: For broad file pattern matching
- **Grep**: For powerful regex-based content searching
- **Read**: For examining specific files I've located
- **Bash**: For read-only operations only (ls, git commands, etc.)

I can see this is a Python FastAPI project (claude-code-harness) with:
- Git repo: main branch (clean status)
- Working directory: /Users/chajinhyeog/workspace/claude-code-harness
- Recent commits initializing the project
- Comprehensive project guidelines in CLAUDE.md covering FastAPI patterns, JSON-based data storage, testing, and domain knowledge systems

I'm ready to help you explore and understand this codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
